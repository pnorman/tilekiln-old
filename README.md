# Tilekiln

## Background

Tilekiln is a set of command-line utilities to generate and serve Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVTs).

Generation relies on the standard method of a PostgreSQL + PostGIS server as a data source, and ST_AsMVT to serialize the MVTs.

The target use-case is vector tiles for OpenStreetMap Carto on openstreetmap.org, a worldwide complex basemap under high load.

Minutely updates are supported with an appropriately updating database.

## Requirements

Tilekiln requires a PostGIS database with data loaded to generate vector tiles.

[OpenStreetMap Carto's](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/blob/master/INSTALL.md#openstreetmap-data) directions are a good starting place for loading OpenStreetMap data into a PostGIS database, but any PostGIS data source in EPSG 3857 will work.

- PostgreSQL 9.5+
- PostGIS 2.4+, 3.0 is strongly recommended

## History

The tilekiln configuration syntax is based on studies and experience with other vector tile and map generation configurations. In particular, it is heavily inspired by Tilezen's use of Jinja2 templates and TileJSON for necessary metadata.

Tilekiln v0.0.x was written in Python and established the configuration format met all the requirements, but the implementation failed to scale on sufficiently powerful machines and the storage mechanisms had issues.
