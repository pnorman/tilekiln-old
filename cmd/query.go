	queryCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("tile", "t", "", "z/x/y of tile to generate")
	queryCmd.MarkPersistentFlagRequired("tile")
	queryCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("layer", "l", "", "Tile layer generator to generate SQL for. If missing, all layers are generated.")
	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// queryCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
